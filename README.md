# Simple SQL Music Store Project

Welcome to the Simple SQL Music Store Project! This beginner-friendly project allows you to practice SQL queries and database management using MySQL. The database contains tables related to a music store, including `album`, `artist`, `customer`, `employee`, `genre`, `invoice`, `invoice_line`, `media_type`, `playlist`, `playlist_track`, and `track`.

## Project Overview

- **Database Engine**: MySQL
- **Database Schema**: Music Store Database

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: This directory contains CSV files that can be used to create tables for the music store database.

- **`music_store_query.sql`**: This SQL script file includes queries for creating the database tables and performing various exercises and tasks related to the music store database.

- **`README.md`**: You're currently reading the project's main README file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sukannia-suresh/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Set Up MySQL**: Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

3. **Create the Database**: Use the provided CSV files to create the tables for the music store database. You can do this by running the SQL script:

   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p < music_store_query.sql
   ```

   Replace `username` with your MySQL username and enter your MySQL password when prompted.

4. **Explore SQL Queries**: Open the `music_store_query.sql` file to find a variety of SQL exercises and queries related to the music store database. Each section includes SQL queries and a brief description of the task or exercise.

5. **Practice**: Try out the SQL queries and exercises to improve your SQL skills. Experiment with modifying the queries or creating your own.
